- Used CRA to setup react
- On hover over the dropdown menu, the dropdown list appears without needing to click on it.
- Once a option is selected the dropdown menu disappears.
- Used two components: App and Dropdown
- The App component passes functions as props to the Dropdown component where it is called as callbacks
